Greetings! I am a PhD student at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Peking University. As of February 2024, I am working as a visiting student at the Department of Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany.

I was born and raised in Guangzhou, a mega city in South China. I earned my bachelor's degree from the School of Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University, where I first researched the effects of doubling CO2 on Earth's temperature structure using a simple one-dimensional climate model. Subsequently, I started to pursue my PhD at Peking University in 2021, shifting my research focus from Earth to more general Earth-like terrestrial planets. My work involved using climate models of varying complexity to study the habitability of these planets.

Starting this February, I have been a visiting PhD student at MPIA, where I changed my research focus to a temperate mini-Neptune, K2-18b. I am investigating the chemistry and dynamics of this planet using both 1D and 3D forward models.

April 2024: My second first-author paper is out at Science Advances. Typically, people think that higher temperature indicates higher surface precipitation on Earth. However, [in our work](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado2515), we show that this trend reverses in very hot climates (>~320 K) by using climate models of different complexity. The decreasing of precipitation in hot climates will affect the weathering rate, further influencing the carbon-silicate cycle and the habitability of terrestrial planets near the inner edge of the habitable zone.

April 2024: I do a PICO [presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-3504.html) on the reversal of precipitation trend in hot climates at EGU 2024.

February 2024: I arrive at Heidelberg! Start to work on a "real" exoplanet K2-18b.

June 2023: A new paper involving me as a collaborator is published in Nature Astronomy. [In this work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02015-8), we use a cloud-permitting model to simulate the explicit convection of 1:1 tidally locked rocky planets orbiting around low-mass stars with high resolution (4 km x 4 km).

April 2023: I give an oral [presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-2306.html) on the effects of surface gravity at EGU 2023.

February 2023: My first first-author paper is published in the Astrophysical Journal. [In this work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca965), we investigate the effects of surface gravity on water cloud behavior and planetary climate using small-domain cloud-resolving simulations. We also calculate the transmission spectra based on our simulation results to show how gravity and clouds affect the detectability of molecules on Earth-like planets.

September 2022: A paper involving me is published in Geophysical Research Letters. [In this work](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL099599), we demonstrate that precipitation is weaker when atmospheric mass is larger for a given surface temperature. Additionally, the rate at which precipitation increases with rising surface temperature is smaller under a larger atmospheric mass compared to a smaller one.
